#Week 1 MiniProject

##Description

A landing page that collects visitors contact information. Page was built by me from scratch using a screenshot of what the final product should look like. No image files were used and all graphics were designed from scratch.

    -Motivation to complete the project was to get a better understanding of how to use css to create a more appealing web page. I also wanted to get practice using flex boxes which I was able to do while creating the box graphic
    -I built this project to apply the skills I have learned in a full stack boot camp and to see if i could replicate a webpage using just a screenshot of it.
    -This project solves the problem of having an appealing webpage for users to enter there contact information.
    -I learned that I can use flex boxes to create a fun and catchy graphic. I also learned I have the skills to recreate a webpage
